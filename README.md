### **ML Explorations 🚀**  
*A series of Python scripts for testing and implementing various Machine Learning concepts*  

## **Overview**  
This repository is a collection of Python scripts designed to explore and experiment with various Machine Learning (ML) techniques, from fundamental data visualization to advanced deep learning models. Each script focuses on a specific ML concept, offering hands-on implementation and insights into real-world applications.  

## **Key Features & Implementations**  

📊 **Data Handling & Visualization**  
- Read and manipulate datasets using CSV files.  
- Load and explore datasets from the **Seaborn** library.  
- Generate insightful visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to understand data distributions and relationships.  

📈 **Regression Techniques**  
- Implement **Linear Regression** (least squares method) for predictive modeling.  
- Build **Logistic Regression** models for classification problems.  

🔍 **Classification Algorithms**  
- Implement **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for instance-based learning.  
- Train and evaluate **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** for classification.  
- Develop **Decision Trees** and analyze their performance using **cross-validation** techniques.  

🌲 **Ensemble Learning**  
- Build and compare **Random Forests** and **Gradient Boosted Trees** to improve predictive accuracy.  
- Analyze feature importance and model generalization capabilities.  

🧠 **Neural Networks & Deep Learning (Optional)**  
- Experiment with **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** for classification tasks.  
- (Optional) Dive into **Deep Learning** using **TensorFlow/Keras** for more complex models.  

🔬 **Unsupervised Learning & Dimensionality Reduction**  
- Implement **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and other dimensionality reduction techniques.  
- Perform **Clustering** using algorithms like **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering**.  

## **Getting Started**  
To run the scripts, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install dependencies using:  
```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
